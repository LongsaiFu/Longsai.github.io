        <h2><b>var, let and const</b></h2>
           <p>
            In the JavaScript, we have Variables. And var, let and const can 
            can help us to create Variables. But sometimes, if you use "ver" to
            create Variables, you would get some conflict. So, we better use let 
            and const. Thers are some different between const and let. "const"
            can make the Variables only have a value
           </p>

        <h2><b>=</b></h2>

           <p>
            We can use "=" to give a value for a Variables.
